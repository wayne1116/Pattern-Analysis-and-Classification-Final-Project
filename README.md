# Pattern-Analysis-and-Classification-Final-Project
### Objective
In our final project, we want to improve the ViT finetuning task perfromance or the converge speed training from scratch. One method we propose is multi-task strategy. We also propose other two methods including the newest otimizer and metric learning strategy, but in this code, we only provide the multi-task method.

### Dataset
- Oxford-III-Pets: it is a pet dataset. There are totally 37 kind of dogs and cats in this dataset. Each pet has roughly 200 images. It also provides classification labels and bounding boxes with pet facial contours. 

### Experiments
Here is our experiment results on multi-task methods.
